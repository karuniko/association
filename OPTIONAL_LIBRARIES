DESCRIPTION
This file contains information about libraries that are supported
by code in OFBiz but that are left out of SVN because of licensing issues.
What is below is a list of jar files and where to put them, and the file(s)
to change to include them in the OFBiz build and/or run-time configuration.

NOTE: While these aren't included in the main SVN repository they are available
on the old Undersun SVN server in the specialized/libraries component directory.

-JavaScript/Rhino (NPL 1.1):
  http://www.mozilla.org/js
  TO BUILD comment out exclude: base/build.xml:org/apache/ofbiz/base/util/OfbizJsBsfEngine.java

-applets (Netscape javascript plugin : Sun Binary Code License Agreement - BCLA)
  Developpers : http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/3.0/handbook/javascript/packages.htm
  This link is also interesting : http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=516303&tstart=225
  NOTE: applications/product/src/ShipmentScaleApplet.java needs  netscape.javascript.JSObject
     If you're using the Sun JDK/JRE 1.4 or greater, the jar is located under jre/lib and it's called plugin.jar.
     You may also find it in the old Undersun SVN server in the specialized/libraries component directory.
  TO BUILD: Copy plugin.jar in framework/base/lib. This seems only needed under Windows.

-JasperReports (LGPL):
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperreports
  TO BUILD comment out excludes:
    framework/webapp/build.xml:org/apache/ofbiz/webapp/view/JasperReportsPdfViewHandler.java,org/apache/ofbiz/webapp/view/JasperReportsXmlViewHandler.java
    applications/content/build.xml:org/apache/ofbiz/content/report/JREntityListIteratorDataSource.java,org/apache/ofbiz/content/report/JRMapCollectionDataSource.java

- JIMI (used by FOP ):
  http://java.sun.com/products/jimi
    FOP may require a library called JIMI to print certain graphical formats such as GIFs.  Jimi is a Sun library which cannot
    be included in OFBIZ due to licensing incompatibility, but you can download it yourself at: http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/
    and rename the ZIP file that comes with it as jimi-xxx.jar, then copy it into the same directory as fop.jar, which at this time
    is ${ofbiz.home}/framework/webapp/lib/
